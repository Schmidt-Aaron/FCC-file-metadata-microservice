## File metadata API
This is a small file upload API built with Node, Express Generator, and the multer npm module. It is part of the Free Code Camp backend API projects. 

Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://aryanj-file-size.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Glitch.

Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

User Story: I can submit a FormData object that includes a file upload.

User Story: When I submit something, I will receive the file size in bytes within the JSON response

Hint: You may want to use this package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer

Once you've finished implementing these user stories, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and enter the URLs for both your GitHub repository and your live app running on Glitch.

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
